    <p>In 1981, seven engineers started Infosys Limited with just US$250.

        Infosys has a growing global presence with over <mark>300,000 employees</mark>. Globally, we have operations spread across <mark>50+ countries</mark>.<br>
        
        At Infosys, we believe our responsibilities extend beyond business. That is why we established the Infosys Foundation – to provide assistance to some of the more socially and economically depressed sectors of the communities in which we work. And that is why we behave ethically and honestly in all our interactions – with our clients, our partners, and our employees.
